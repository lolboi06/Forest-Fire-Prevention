# Forest-Fire-Prevention
 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Detection System Using AI  

## 🔥 Why This Project?  
Wildfires are **destructive and unpredictable**. But what if AI could **detect them early** using satellite and drone images?  
This project does exactly that—**identifying forest fires before they spread** using deep learning.

## 🚀 What This Project Does  
✅ **AI-Powered Fire Detection** – Classifies images as "Fire" or "No Fire"  
✅ **Real-Time Analysis** – Works with aerial & satellite images  
✅ **Fast & Simple** – Just feed an image, and the model detects fire risk  
✅ **Customizable & Open-Source** – Improve, fine-tune, and deploy it
