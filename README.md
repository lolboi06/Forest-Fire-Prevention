# Forest-Fire-Prevention
 ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Detection System Using AI  

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Project?  
Wildfires are **destructive and unpredictable**. But what if AI could **detect them early** using satellite and drone images?  
This project does exactly thatâ€”**identifying forest fires before they spread** using deep learning.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does  
âœ… **AI-Powered Fire Detection** â€“ Classifies images as "Fire" or "No Fire"  
âœ… **Real-Time Analysis** â€“ Works with aerial & satellite images  
âœ… **Fast & Simple** â€“ Just feed an image, and the model detects fire risk  
âœ… **Customizable & Open-Source** â€“ Improve, fine-tune, and deploy it
